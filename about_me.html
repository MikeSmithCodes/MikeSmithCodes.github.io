            <h3>In the Office</h3>
            <p>
                I am drawn to hard problems and get bored when the work is too repetitive. For that reason, I've become a bit 
                of a jack of all trades but they say that is better than a master of one. I prefer to build skills that are 
                widely applicable and relate to first principles. I am also a people person. I like building relationships 
                with the people I interact with and find the work more enjoyable when you can chat about families or trips in 
                the hallway between meetings. I've worked in the aviation, space, automotive, and healthcare industries. The 
                diversity of those experiences has helped me a lot in terms of quickly spotting trends that are productive 
                versus problematic and it has helped me communicate with technical and non-technical groups no matter their 
                background.
            </p>
            <h3>In the Classroom</h3>
            <p>
                My undergraduate degree was in Aerospace Engineering. In addition to the coursework, I led a number of teams
                representing the school in competitions to design, build, and fly model aircraft. Scoring usually centered 
                around maximizing payload weight while minimizing the empty weight for the airplane. Two lessons 
                stuck with me. First, as you as you start committing to a design, you immediately feel the pain from any 
                compromises you needed to make. That said, if you try to optimize every detail, you won't have a plane to 
                fly on the day of competition. Second, what works on paper, or in simulations, needs real world validation.
            </p>
            <p>
                My graduate degree was in Computer Science. Most of the coursework touched on various aspects of Artificial 
                Intelligence. I learned a lot and still go back and improve on some of the projects. In particular I enjoyed 
                building models to solve puzzles and games, predicting stock market behavior, and determining the location and 
                optimal paths for autonomous vehicles. I could spend lifetimes on these problems and never be bored. Recent 
                advancements in these areas only spark a greater interest too.
            </p>
            <h3>Spare Time</h3>
            <p>
                Not much beats making a pile of saw dust on a Fall day. I've built a handful of tables and enjoy every step of 
                the process. It is easy to overlook the complexities of even a simple project as you get into woodworking but 
                you quickly learn there is a lot of consider. What wood and materials should you use? What direction should the 
                grain go? What is the temperature and humidity of the shop? There is a real sense of pride when the project ends
                too.
            </p>
            <p>
                I do not get outside enough, but when I do, I enjoy every second. I like anything on or around the water, biking, 
                and playing sports. I have a love-hate relationship with golf which anyone who has played will understand. Finally, 
                I always have an audiobook in progress and another on deck.
