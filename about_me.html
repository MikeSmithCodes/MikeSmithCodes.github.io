            <h3>Hi there!</h3>
            <p>
                So you want to know more about me, eh? Well... <i>*slowly reclining onto the therapist's couch,
                taking time to adjust the pillow, then letting out a heavy sigh*</i>... there is not much 
                to share.
            </p>
            <h3>In the Office</h3>
            <p>
                TBD 
            </p>
            <h3>In the Classroom</h3>
            <p>
                My undergraduate degree was in Aerospace Engineering. Iowa State University was a great school and 
                offered me a lot of opportunities to tailor my education. I was quickly drawn to aircraft competitions 
                where colleges around the world compete to design, build, and fly model aircraft. Scoring using centered 
                around maximizing the weight of the payload while minimizing the empty weight of the airplane. Two lessons 
                stuck with me. First, as you as you start committing to a design, you start to feel the pain from any 
                compromises you needed to make. That said, if you try to optimize every detail, you won't have a plane to 
                fly on the day of competition. Second, what works on paper or in simulations needs real world validation. 
                I learned a lot every year and felt these extracurricular projects complemented my coursework well.
            </p>
            <p>
                My graduate degree was in Computer Science. Georgia Tech was a great school for very different reasons. At 
                Georgia Tech the courses were largely predetermined and coursework itself was less collaborative. The 
                coursework was challenging, especially with a full-time job, but the topics were interesting. I have revisited 
                a few of my projects since graduating to make updates.
            </p>
            <h3>Spare Time</h3>
            <p>
                My happy place is in front of a mitre saw with Eric Church on the speakers and a cold drink 
                not too far from the tape measure. I spend a lot of time in front of computer screens so it is nice 
                throw some saw dust around the garage and build an appreciation for physical problems like how the 
                grain direction or humidity might impact a table top's surface over time.
            </p>
            <p>
                As a girl dad, my tools have spent more time idle while I play "school" and "family." This isn't how 
                I thought I would spend my years but it really is the best. Sweeping the floor 100 times a day while 
                stepping on toys I just picked up is a small cost to pay for the joys of fatherhood.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, getting outside is great and I kick myself for not doing more of it. I enjoy anything on or 
                near the water, biking, and playing sports.
            </p>
